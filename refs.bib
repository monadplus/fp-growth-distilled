abstract = {In order to meet the uncertain data stream mining demand in large dynamic database, a frequent probability item mining algorithm was proposed base on sliding window. The mass data in the database was regarded as a data stream. In the window model of data stream, the frequent item set was extracted according to the probability frequency distribution information of data. Compared to the traditional algorithm, the mining environmental constraints of the certain data stream was overcome, the defect that the relevant information was easy to lose was improved. The true information of data was reflected fully, and the most accurate frequent item was minded. Simulation result shows that the new algorithm can mine the frequent items accurately, and the accuracy rate is higher than the traditional method. It can process the data quickly. It provides effective strategy for analyzing the large database, and it can meet the memory requirement and performance requirement in database analysis and mining.}
